## About
Graede brings all of your student grades in one place, making them
instantly searchable and accessible from anywhere.

My goal is to provide teachers a service that will make sending 
grades to students hassle-free which will make their school life 
easier, and more productive.

I also provide a [Grade Viewer](https://github.com/DareAngeL/Graede-Viewer) for students where they can 
view their grades anytime and anywhere using their smartphones.

## What
Graede has a table where teachers can put the grades of their students 
ranging from quizzes to semester grades, allowing them to put any type of grades.
Teachers can also import excel data, calculate their students grade and publish 
their workspace for their students to be able to view thier grades.

## Technology
This uses the old Java technology which is the Swing GUI Toolkit.
I chose this technology because it has a wide variety of widgets 
for building optimized window based applications and is lightweight.
This also uses the JavaFX technology for web embedding.
